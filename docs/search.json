The small p-values in both tests (t-test and regression) tell us that the observed differences in donation rates between the control and treatment groups are highly unlikely to have occurred by chance (p &lt; 0.05). This provides strong evidence in favor of the treatment’s impact on increasing donation rates. The results indicate that even small incentives or changes in how donations are solicited (like matching donations) can positively affect donor behavior. This aligns with behavioral economic theories suggesting that people are more likely to engage in pro-social behavior (like donating to charity) if they perceive their contribution as being more impactful or if they receive some form of positive reinforcement or matching contribution.\n\n\nOptimization terminated successfully.\n         Current function value: 0.100443\n         Iterations 7\n\n\n\n\nProbit Regression Results\n\n\nDep.

Although the 1:1 match ratio also shows an increase in donation probability (by 0.3 percentage points), this effect is only marginally significant (p-value of 0.097).\n\n\ndirect_1:1 vs 2:1: 0.0019 direct_2:1 vs 3:1: 0.0001\ncoef_1:1 vs 2:1: 0.002 coef_2:1 vs 3:1: 0.0\n\n\nThe analysis reveals that increasing the match ratio from 1:1 to 2:1 enhances the probability of donation by approximately 0.188% (direct calculation) and predicts a 0.2% increase based on regression coefficients, indicating a statistically significant effect that suggests a higher match ratio effectively encourages more donations. However, further increasing the match ratio from 2:1 to 3:1 shows a negligible increase in donation likelihood (only 0.01% as per direct calculation) and no effect according to regression coefficients (0.0%), suggesting that beyond a 2:1 match, there are diminishing returns in terms of motivating additional donations. This pattern underscores the effectiveness of moderate increases in match ratios while highlighting a threshold beyond which higher ratios do not yield proportional gains in donor engagement.\n\n\nSize of Charitable Contribution\nIn this subsection, I analyze the effect of the size of matched donation on the size of the charitable contribution.\nThe t-test indicates a relatively weak statistically significant difference in donation amounts between the treatment and control groups (p-value=0.055). By performing these analyses, we learn whether the treatment effectively increases donation amounts and quantifies the increase. This helps in understanding the financial impact of the treatment and can guide future decisions regarding the use of such treatments to boost donations.\nWhat happens if we limit the data to just people who made a donation and repeat the previous analysis?\n\n\nLinear regression (OLS)\nData                 : donors_data\nResponse variable    : amount\nExplanatory variables: treatment\nNull hyp.: the effect of x on amount is zero\nAlt. hyp.: the effect of x on amount is not zero\n\n           coefficient  std.error  t.value p.value     \nIntercept       45.540      2.423   18.792  &lt; .001  ***\ntreatment       -1.668      2.872   -0.581   0.561     \n\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\nR-squared: 0.0, Adjusted R-squared: -0.001\nF-statistic: 0.337 df(1, 1032), p.value 0.561\nNr obs: 1,034\n\n\nOn average, individuals in the control group (or baseline category, assuming treatment = 0) donate $45.54. This is significantly different from zero (p &lt; .001), suggesting a high confidence in this average donation amount among the control group donors.\nBeing in the treatment group is associated with a decrease in the donation amount by $1.668 compared to the control group, although this effect is not statistically significant (p = 0.561). This implies that there is no strong evidence to suggest that treatment status influences the donation amount among those who chose to donate.\nIf the treatment was randomly assigned among participants, then the coefficient can be interpreted causally as the effect of the treatment on donation amounts among donors. This causal interpretation is valid under the assumption of random assignment."

The critical ratio (CR) is used to determine the target service level and is defined as: \\[(\\frac{Cu}{Cu+Co})\\]\nhere, Cu=$20, and Co=$2, CR=20/(20+2) \\(\\approx\\) 0.9091 \n\n\n\n# Constants\nP = 22  # Selling price per book\nCo = 2   # Cost of production per book (real cost outlay)\nW = 14  # Wholesale price per book (internal transfer, not considered here)\n\n# Given values\nmu = 20000  # Approximate mean from data\nsigma = 2000  # Standard deviation from data\nz = 1.34  # CR\n\n# Calculate the optimal order quantity.\nQ_print = mu + z * sigma\n\nprofits = []\nfor demand in demand_data['Demand']:\n    sold_books = min(demand, Q_print)\n    unsold_books = max(Q_print - demand, 0)\n    \n    # Total profit calculation\n    profit = sold_books * (P - Co) - unsold_books * Co\n    profits.append(profit)\n\n# Average profit calculation\naverage_profit = sum(profits) / len(profits)\n(Q_print, average_profit)\n\n(22680.0, 393106.072)\n\n\nTherefore, based on the data, the supply chain should print 22,680 books and the supply chain average profit is approximately $393,106."

The data include the following variables:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable Definitions\n\n\n\n\n\n- `id` = unique ID number for each unit\n- `last_scraped` = date when information scraped\n- `host_since` = date when host first listed the unit on Airbnb\n- `days` = `last_scraped` - `host_since` = number of days the unit has been listed\n- `room_type` = Entire home/apt., Private room, or Shared room\n- `bathrooms` = number of bathrooms\n- `bedrooms` = number of bedrooms\n- `price` = price per night (dollars)\n- `number_of_reviews` = number of reviews for the unit on Airbnb\n- `review_scores_cleanliness` = a cleanliness score from reviews (1-10)\n- `review_scores_location` = a \"quality of location\" score from reviews (1-10)\n- `review_scores_value` = a \"quality of value\" score from reviews (1-10)\n- `instant_bookable` = \"t\" if instantly bookable, \"f\" if not\n\n\n\nPreparing the Data\n\n\nCode\nairbnb_data = pd.read_csv('data/airbnb.csv')\n# Drop the 'Unnamed: 0' as it is just an index column and convert date columns to datetime\nairbnb_data.drop(columns=['Unnamed: 0'], inplace=True)\nairbnb_data['last_scraped'] = pd.to_datetime(airbnb_data['last_scraped'])\nairbnb_data['host_since'] = pd.to_datetime(airbnb_data['host_since'])\n\n# Handling missing values by imputation\n# For bathrooms and bedrooms, fill missing values with the median (common practice for count data)\n# For review scores, impute with the median (since they are ratings out of 10, median is a reasonable choice)\nmedian_values = {\n    'bathrooms': airbnb_data['bathrooms'].median(),\n    'bedrooms': airbnb_data['bedrooms'].median(),\n    'review_scores_cleanliness': airbnb_data['review_scores_cleanliness'].median(),\n    'review_scores_location': airbnb_data['review_scores_location'].median(),\n    'review_scores_value': airbnb_data['review_scores_value'].median()\n}\nairbnb_data.fillna(median_values, inplace=True)\n\n# Encoding categorical variables using one-hot encoding\nairbnb_data = pd.get_dummies(airbnb_data, columns=['room_type', 'instant_bookable'], drop_first=True)\n\n\nPlotting Number of Reviews\n\n\nCode\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n# Setting the aesthetics for the plots\nsns.set(style=\"whitegrid\")\n# Distribution of number of reviews\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\nsns.histplot(airbnb_data['number_of_reviews'], bins=30, kde=True)\nplt.title('Distribution of Number of Reviews')\nplt.xlabel('Number of Reviews')\nplt.ylabel('Frequency')\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that the plot for number of reviews is heavily right skewed, indicating most of the listings have only a few reviews and listings with high number of reviews are on the more extreme side of this dataset.\n\nBuilding model\n\n\nCode\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\n\n# Convert all columns explicitly to float, except for the ones already identified as categorical, which will be integers\ncolumns_to_convert = ['days', 'bathrooms', 'bedrooms', 'price', 'review_scores_cleanliness', \n                      'review_scores_location', 'review_scores_value']\n\nfor col in columns_to_convert:\n    airbnb_data[col] = airbnb_data[col].astype('float64')\n\n# Prepare the data for the model\nX = airbnb_data.drop(columns=['id', 'number_of_reviews', 'last_scraped', 'host_since'])\ny = airbnb_data['number_of_reviews']\n\n# Add a constant to the independent variable set\nX = sm.add_constant(X)\n\n# Attempt to fit the Poisson regression model again, converting X explicitly to ensure no 'object' dtype slips through\ntry:\n    X = X.astype('float64')\n    poisson_model = sm.GLM(y, X, family=sm.families.Poisson()).fit()\n    model_summary = poisson_model.summary()\nexcept Exception as e:\n    model_summary = str(e)\n\n\n\nDays (days): Coefficient is positive (≈0.00005), indicating a small but positive association between the length of listing duration and the number of reviews. This implies that for each additional day a listing is available, the expected log count of reviews increases slightly.\nBathrooms (bathrooms): Coefficient is negative (−0.1161), suggesting that listings with more bathrooms tend to have slightly fewer reviews. This might indicate larger properties are booked less frequently.\nBedrooms (bedrooms): Coefficient is positive (0.0702), meaning that additional bedrooms are associated with an increase in the number of reviews, possibly indicating that larger capacity listings attract more guests/reviews.\nPrice (price): Coefficient is negative (−0.0002), indicating that higher prices are associated with fewer reviews, suggesting price sensitivity among bookers.\nReview Scores (Cleanliness, Location, Value): All have significant impacts. Higher cleanliness scores increase the review count (positive coefficient), whereas better location and value scores are associated with fewer reviews (negative coefficients), which might suggest that expectations are higher in well-located or good value properties, affecting review behaviors.\nRoom Type: Listings that are private rooms (−0.1457) or shared rooms (−0.4171) have fewer reviews compared to entire homes/apartments, with shared rooms showing a much stronger negative effect.\nInstant Bookable (instant_bookable_t): Having the listing available for instant booking is positively associated with the number of reviews (0.3468), suggesting that ease of booking contributes to more bookings and hence more reviews."

    "text": "1. Estimating Yogurt Preferences\n\nLikelihood for the Multi-nomial Logit (MNL) Model\nSuppose we have \\(i=1,\\ldots,n\\) consumers who each select exactly one product \\(j\\) from a set of \\(J\\) products. The outcome variable is the identity of the product chosen \\(y_i \\in \\{1, \\ldots, J\\}\\) or equivalently a vector of \\(J-1\\) zeros and \\(1\\) one, where the \\(1\\) indicates the selected product. For example, if the third product was chosen out of 4 products, then either \\(y=3\\) or \\(y=(0,0,1,0)\\) depending on how we want to represent it. Suppose also that we have a vector of data on each product \\(x_j\\) (eg, size, price, etc.).\nWe model the consumer’s decision as the selection of the product that provides the most utility, and we’ll specify the utility function as a linear function of the product characteristics:\n\\[ U_{ij} = x_j'\\beta + \\epsilon_{ij} \\]\nwhere \\(\\epsilon_{ij}\\) is an i.i.d. extreme value error term.\nThe choice of the i.i.d. extreme value error term leads to a closed-form expression for the probability that consumer \\(i\\) chooses product \\(j\\):\n\\[ \\mathbb{P}_i(j) = \\frac{e^{x_j'\\beta}}{\\sum_{k=1}^Je^{x_k'\\beta}} \\]\nFor example, if there are 4 products, the probability that consumer \\(i\\) chooses product 3 is:\n\\[ \\mathbb{P}_i(3) = \\frac{e^{x_3'\\beta}}{e^{x_1'\\beta} + e^{x_2'\\beta} + e^{x_3'\\beta} + e^{x_4'\\beta}} \\]\nA clever way to write the individual likelihood function for consumer \\(i\\) is the product of the \\(J\\) probabilities, each raised to the power of an indicator variable (\\(\\delta_{ij}\\)) that indicates the chosen product:\n\\[ L_i(\\beta) = \\prod_{j=1}^J \\mathbb{P}_i(j)^{\\delta_{ij}} = \\mathbb{P}_i(1)^{\\delta_{i1}} \\times \\ldots \\times \\mathbb{P}_i(J)^{\\delta_{iJ}}\\]\nNotice that if the consumer selected product \\(j=3\\), then \\(\\delta_{i3}=1\\) while \\(\\delta_{i1}=\\delta_{i2}=\\delta_{i4}=0\\) and the likelihood is:\n\\[ L_i(\\beta) = \\mathbb{P}_i(1)^0 \\times \\mathbb{P}_i(2)^0 \\times \\mathbb{P}_i(3)^1 \\times \\mathbb{P}_i(4)^0 = \\mathbb{P}_i(3) = \\frac{e^{x_3'\\beta}}{\\sum_{k=1}^Je^{x_k'\\beta}} \\]\nThe joint likelihood (across all consumers) is the product of the \\(n\\) individual likelihoods:\n\\[ L_n(\\beta) = \\prod_{i=1}^n L_i(\\beta) = \\prod_{i=1}^n \\prod_{j=1}^J \\mathbb{P}_i(j)^{\\delta_{ij}} \\]\nAnd the joint log-likelihood function is:\n\\[ \\ell_n(\\beta) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^J \\delta_{ij} \\log(\\mathbb{P}_i(j)) \\]\n\n\nYogurt Dataset\nWe will use the yogurt_data dataset, which provides anonymized consumer identifiers (id), a vector indicating the chosen product (y1:y4), a vector indicating if any products were “featured” in the store as a form of advertising (f1:f4), and the products’ prices (p1:p4). For example, consumer 1 purchased yogurt 4 at a price of 0.079/oz and none of the yogurts were featured/advertised at the time of consumer 1’s purchase. Consumers 2 through 7 each bought yogurt 2, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid\ny1\ny2\ny3\ny4\nf1\nf2\nf3\nf4\np1\np2\np3\np4\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0.108\n0.081\n0.061\n0.079\n\n\n1\n2\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0.108\n0.098\n0.064\n0.075\n\n\n2\n3\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0.108\n0.098\n0.061\n0.086\n\n\n3\n4\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0.108\n0.098\n0.061\n0.086\n\n\n4\n5\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0.125\n0.098\n0.049\n0.079\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid: An anonymized consumer identifier.\ny1, y2, y3, y4: Binary vectors indicating which yogurt product (1 through 4) was chosen by the consumer.\nf1, f2, f3, f4: Binary vectors indicating if yogurt products (1 through 4) were featured/advertised in the store at the time of purchase.\np1, p2, p3, p4: Prices of yogurt products (1 through 4) per ounce.\nLet the vector of product features include brand dummy variables for yogurts 1-3 (we’ll omit a dummy for product 4 to avoid multi-collinearity), a dummy variable to indicate if a yogurt was featured, and a continuous variable for the yogurts’ prices:\n\\[ x_j' = [\\mathbbm{1}(\\text{Yogurt 1}), \\mathbbm{1}(\\text{Yogurt 2}), \\mathbbm{1}(\\text{Yogurt 3}), X_f, X_p] \\]\nThe “hard part” of the MNL likelihood function is organizing the data, as we need to keep track of 3 dimensions (consumer \\(i\\), covariate \\(k\\), and product \\(j\\)) instead of the typical 2 dimensions for cross-sectional regression models (consumer \\(i\\) and covariate \\(k\\)).\nWhat we would like to do is reorganize the data from a “wide” shape with \\(n\\) rows and multiple columns for each covariate, to a “long” shape with \\(n \\times J\\) rows and a single column for each covariate. As part of this re-organization, we’ll add binary variables to indicate the first 3 products; the variables for featured and price are included in the dataset and simply need to be “pivoted” or “melted” from wide to long.\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Reshape the data from wide to long format for features and prices\nfeatures_long = pd.melt(data, id_vars=['id'], value_vars=['f1', 'f2', 'f3', 'f4'],\n                        var_name='feature', value_name='X_f')\nfeatures_long['product'] = features_long['feature'].str.extract(r'(\\d)').astype(int)\n\nprices_long = pd.melt(data, id_vars=['id'], value_vars=['p1', 'p2', 'p3', 'p4'],\n                      var_name='price', value_name='X_p')\nprices_long['product'] = prices_long['price'].str.extract(r'(\\d)').astype(int)\n\n# Merge features and prices\ndf_long = pd.merge(features_long[['id', 'product', 'X_f']], prices_long[['id', 'product', 'X_p']], on=['id', 'product'])\n\n# Create binary indicators for each product\ndf_long['Yogurt1'] = (df_long['product'] == 1).astype(int)\ndf_long['Yogurt2'] = (df_long['product'] == 2).astype(int)\ndf_long['Yogurt3'] = (df_long['product'] == 3).astype(int)\n\n# Create the dependent variable y (product choice) in long format\nchoices_long = pd.melt(data, id_vars=['id'], value_vars=['y1', 'y2', 'y3', 'y4'],\n                       var_name='chosen', value_name='choice')\nchoices_long['product'] = choices_long['chosen'].str.extract(r'(\\d)').astype(int)\n\n# Merge with the main dataframe to get the choice indicator\ndf_long = pd.merge(df_long, choices_long[['id', 'product', 'choice']], on=['id', 'product'], how='left')\n\n# Display the prepared data\ndf_long.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid\nproduct\nX_f\nX_p\nYogurt1\nYogurt2\nYogurt3\nchoice\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0.108\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n1\n2\n1\n0\n0.108\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n2\n3\n1\n0\n0.108\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n3\n4\n1\n0\n0.108\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n4\n5\n1\n0\n0.125\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimation\nThe log-likelihood function is \\(\\ell_n(\\beta) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^J \\delta_{ij} x_j' \\beta - \\sum_{i=1}^n \\log \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^J e^{x_k' \\beta} \\right)\\)\n\n\nCode\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\n# Prepare the independent variables (X)\nindependent_vars = ['Yogurt1', 'Yogurt2', 'Yogurt3', 'X_f', 'X_p']\nX = df_long[independent_vars]\n\n# Add intercept\nX = sm.add_constant(X)\n\n# Prepare the dependent variable (y)\ny = df_long['choice']\n\n# Fit the multinomial logit model\nmodel = sm.MNLogit(y, X)\nresult = model.fit()\n\n# Print the results\nresult.summary()\n\n\nOptimization terminated successfully.\n         Current function value: 0.477971\n         Iterations 7\n\n\n\n\nMNLogit Regression Results\n\n\nDep.

It assumes that each consumer selects the product that provides the highest utility, where the utility is a linear function of product characteristics and an error term that follows an extreme value distribution.\nBuilding and analyzing the MNL model provided several key insights:\nConsumer Preferences: The model identified the most and least preferred yogurts based on their baseline utilities.\nPrice Sensitivity: The negative price coefficient highlighted the importance of pricing in consumer decision-making.\nPredictive Power: The model’s ability to simulate counterfactual scenarios and predict changes in market shares underscores its utility for strategic decision-making in marketing and product management.\n\nMost Preferred Yogurt: The yogurt with the highest intercept is Yogurt 1 (intercept = 1.2830).\nLeast Preferred Yogurt: The yogurt with the lowest intercept is Yogurt 3 (intercept = -3.1405).\n\nThe estimated coefficient for the price variable is -31.9761. This coefficient tells us how much utility changes with a change in price.\nTo calculate the dollar benefit between the most preferred and the least preferred yogurt: Difference in Utility: Intercept of Yogurt 1−Intercept of Yogurt 3=1.2830−(−3.1405)=4.4235\nDollar Benefit=4.4235/31.9761≈0.1383 dollars per unit.\nOne benefit of the MNL model is that we can simulate counterfactuals (eg, what if the price of yogurt 1 was $0.10/oz instead of $0.08/oz).\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\n# Calculate the initial probabilities\ndef calculate_probabilities(X, model):\n    # Reshape model.params to match the dimensions for matrix multiplication\n    params = model.params.values.flatten()\n    linear_combination = np.dot(X, params)\n    exp_linear_combination = np.exp(linear_combination.reshape(-1, 4))\n    probabilities = exp_linear_combination / np.sum(exp_linear_combination, axis=1, keepdims=True)\n    return probabilities\n\n# Prepare the initial data\nX_initial = df_long[independent_vars]\nX_initial = sm.add_constant(X_initial)\n\n# Calculate initial probabilities\nprobabilities_initial = calculate_probabilities(X_initial, result)\n\n# Calculate initial market shares\ninitial_market_shares = np.mean(probabilities_initial, axis=0)\n\n# Simulate a counterfactual scenario: Increase the price of Yogurt 1 by $0.10\ndf_long_counterfactual = df_long.copy()\ndf_long_counterfactual.loc[df_long_counterfactual['product'] == 1, 'X_p'] += 0.10\n\n# Prepare the counterfactual data\nX_counterfactual = df_long_counterfactual[independent_vars]\nX_counterfactual = sm.add_constant(X_counterfactual)\n\n# Calculate counterfactual probabilities\nprobabilities_counterfactual = calculate_probabilities(X_counterfactual, result)\n\n# Calculate new market shares\nnew_market_shares = np.mean(probabilities_counterfactual, axis=0)\n\n# Print initial and new market shares\ninitial_market_shares, new_market_shares\n\n\n(array([0.25112971, 0.2468373 , 0.25305383, 0.24897917]),\n array([0.2510665 , 0.2467384 , 0.25315639, 0.24903872]))\n\n\n\nWhile the changes are minor, this suggests that increasing the price of Yogurt 1 slightly reduces its market share, and other yogurts see a corresponding small increase in their market shares. ## 2.
