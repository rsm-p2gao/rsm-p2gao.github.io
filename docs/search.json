The small p-values in both tests (t-test and regression) tell us that the observed differences in donation rates between the control and treatment groups are highly unlikely to have occurred by chance (p &lt; 0.05). This provides strong evidence in favor of the treatment’s impact on increasing donation rates. The results indicate that even small incentives or changes in how donations are solicited (like matching donations) can positively affect donor behavior. This aligns with behavioral economic theories suggesting that people are more likely to engage in pro-social behavior (like donating to charity) if they perceive their contribution as being more impactful or if they receive some form of positive reinforcement or matching contribution.\n\n\nOptimization terminated successfully.\n         Current function value: 0.100443\n         Iterations 7\n\n\n\n\nProbit Regression Results\n\n\nDep.

Although the 1:1 match ratio also shows an increase in donation probability (by 0.3 percentage points), this effect is only marginally significant (p-value of 0.097).\n\n\ndirect_1:1 vs 2:1: 0.0019 direct_2:1 vs 3:1: 0.0001\ncoef_1:1 vs 2:1: 0.002 coef_2:1 vs 3:1: 0.0\n\n\nThe analysis reveals that increasing the match ratio from 1:1 to 2:1 enhances the probability of donation by approximately 0.188% (direct calculation) and predicts a 0.2% increase based on regression coefficients, indicating a statistically significant effect that suggests a higher match ratio effectively encourages more donations. However, further increasing the match ratio from 2:1 to 3:1 shows a negligible increase in donation likelihood (only 0.01% as per direct calculation) and no effect according to regression coefficients (0.0%), suggesting that beyond a 2:1 match, there are diminishing returns in terms of motivating additional donations. This pattern underscores the effectiveness of moderate increases in match ratios while highlighting a threshold beyond which higher ratios do not yield proportional gains in donor engagement.\n\n\nSize of Charitable Contribution\nIn this subsection, I analyze the effect of the size of matched donation on the size of the charitable contribution.\nThe t-test indicates a relatively weak statistically significant difference in donation amounts between the treatment and control groups (p-value=0.055). By performing these analyses, we learn whether the treatment effectively increases donation amounts and quantifies the increase. This helps in understanding the financial impact of the treatment and can guide future decisions regarding the use of such treatments to boost donations.\nWhat happens if we limit the data to just people who made a donation and repeat the previous analysis?\n\n\nLinear regression (OLS)\nData                 : donors_data\nResponse variable    : amount\nExplanatory variables: treatment\nNull hyp.: the effect of x on amount is zero\nAlt. hyp.: the effect of x on amount is not zero\n\n           coefficient  std.error  t.value p.value     \nIntercept       45.540      2.423   18.792  &lt; .001  ***\ntreatment       -1.668      2.872   -0.581   0.561     \n\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\nR-squared: 0.0, Adjusted R-squared: -0.001\nF-statistic: 0.337 df(1, 1032), p.value 0.561\nNr obs: 1,034\n\n\nOn average, individuals in the control group (or baseline category, assuming treatment = 0) donate $45.54. This is significantly different from zero (p &lt; .001), suggesting a high confidence in this average donation amount among the control group donors.\nBeing in the treatment group is associated with a decrease in the donation amount by $1.668 compared to the control group, although this effect is not statistically significant (p = 0.561). This implies that there is no strong evidence to suggest that treatment status influences the donation amount among those who chose to donate.\nIf the treatment was randomly assigned among participants, then the coefficient can be interpreted causally as the effect of the treatment on donation amounts among donors. This causal interpretation is valid under the assumption of random assignment."
